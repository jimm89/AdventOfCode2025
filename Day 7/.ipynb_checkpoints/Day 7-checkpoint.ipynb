We use the information in each row to populate the row below with beams of light. Where we find no splitter, we move the beam directly down, and where we find a splitter, we move the beam either side of it.\n",

    "In part 2, using almost exactly the same code again for simulation purposes, we instead maintain a count of the number of paths in each column. As we work through the rows, we add the paths from each column to the columns they move into in the subsequent row, which is either the same column (no splitter) or the columns either side (splitter)."

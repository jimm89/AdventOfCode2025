    "Today's problem leads to a classic computer science data structure and algorithm used for bringing sets together efficiently: **[disjoint-set union (DSU, also known as union-find)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "DSU is quite simple in operation. It maintains a list of 'parents' and a list of 'sizes' such that when a point is merged with another point:\n",
    "- we **find** the 'ultimate parent' of each point (the parent of the parent of the parent etc)\n",
    "- we merge (form a **union** of) the two 'ultimate parents' by joining the set of smaller size into the set of bigger size, so that the 'ultimate parent' belonging to the set of bigger size becomes the ultimate parent of everything in both sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 1 requires us to:\n",
    "- find the 1000 pairs of points that are closest in terms of [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance): since the distance is likely not to be an integer, we can do this extra precisely by comparing the squares of the Euclidean distances (which _will_ be an integer), since a greater distance will also have a greater square distance\n",
    "- connect those points: the DSU structure will do this super-efficiently (close to constant time), ignoring any points already connected and merging the sets where they are not yet connected\n",
    "- find the three largest set sizes after these 1000 connections have been made (the DSU maintains a list of the set sizes, so this is trivial)\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 2 is very similar except that we don't stop at 1000 connections. We plough on until there is only one giant set of all the points. We can test each iteration whether this has happened by forming the union and then finding the new ultimate parent of both points. If that ultimate parent has size $N$, where $N$ is our number of points, we've finished, and can trivially find our answer."

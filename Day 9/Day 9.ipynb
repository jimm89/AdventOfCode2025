    "Part 1 is again relatively straightforward: just iterate over each possible pair of points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ as a pair of opposite corners in the rectangle. Then the answer is the maximum value of $(|x_2 - x_1| + 1) * (|y_2 - y_1| + 1)$ for all such pairs - note that $+ 1$ is required because each end of the grid is included.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 2 is much more challenging. We need to identify when we should exclude a candidate answer from consideration. This required significant thought, but fortunately once a suitable method is identified, coding it is not too difficult. The crucial observation is that if any line segment of the boundary of our shape passes into or through the candidate rectangle (not just along the boundary), we will necessarily have some empty cells. Why? Because each of those line segments is a boundary between green/red cells and empty cells, so on one side of that line segment, there must be some empty cells. Since our input is structured such that the points are adjacent to the other ends of their line segments, we can perform this pass in $O(N)$ time, where $N$ is the number of points. As we have $O(N^2)$ points, this total complexity of this algorithm is $O(N^3)$, which is sufficient to solve this for approximately 500 points in a reasonable time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note on faster solution\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to solve this problem in $O(N^2)$ time. To do this, we can compress the search space to the size of the distinct number of X and Y values, pre-compute some additional information about the cells in a row as a prefix, to identify whether all those cells are filled. This is not necessary for the input size, but for input any larger it would be the only reasonable option."

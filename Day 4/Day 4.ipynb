    "In part 1, we are faced with a fairly simple task: count neighbouring cells which contain rolls of paper. Let's look a a simple concept for iterate of neighbour cells. Suppose we call a cell $[x, y]$, meaning that it is in row $x$ and column $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Python works with 0-indexed arrays, $0 <= x < n$ and $0 <= y < m$, where $n$ is the number of rows in the grid and $y$ is the number of columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "To examine neighbouring cells, we consider a shift $[dx, dy]$, such that $-1 <= dx <= 1$ and $-1 <= dy <= 1$, where at least one of $dx$ or $dy$ must be non-zero (otherwise it is the cell itself, not the neighbour). Then for cell $[x, y]$ we well examine all cells $[x + dx, y + dy]$ subject to the above constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that a neighbouring cell must be in the grid itself, so we impose two additional constraints: $0 <= x + dx < n$ and $0 <= y + dy < m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this constraints, it is trivial to count neighbouring cells with rolls.\n",
    "\n",
    "In part 2, the problem is much more involved. Naively we might thing \"let's just iterate over the grid as many times as we need to\" - but this could be very slow! There are 20,000 cells, and if we consider a scenario where we need to iterate over the grid from the outside to the centre to remove all rolls, this count take 10,000 iterations. Already we're talking about more than $10^8$ operations, and with a high constant factor for each iteration, we're likely looking at an even higher order of magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, there is a way we can avoid doing all those iterations: [**breadth-first search (BFS)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search). This is a standard efficient graph traversal algorithm which looks at cells ('nodes', in graph terminology) as they become of interest to us, and then does not need to reconsider them again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider our grid as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- each cell $[x, dx]$ is a 'node' (or vertex) of a graph\n",
    "- each neighbour of that cell $[x + dx, y + dy]$ is connected to the $[x, y]$ by an edge\n",
    "\n",
    "BFS works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- find the first cells we are interested in (the ones with rolls with fewer than 4 neighbouring rolls), and add them to a **queue**\n",
    "- process all the cells in the queue one at a time:\n",
    "    - each time we process a cell, we examine its neighbours to see if we have any new cells that need to be added to the queue - this will be the case if they now have fewer than 4 neighbours\n",
    "    - we continue until there are now more cells in the queue, counting every cell that we remove a roll from\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's it! Simple. BFS saves the day."

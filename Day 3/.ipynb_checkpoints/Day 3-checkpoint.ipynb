    "In part 1, the problem is asking us to find the 'numerically largest' subsequence of length 2. In part 2, it asks us to do the same but of length 12 instead.\n",

    "In part 1, a naive solution will suffice since the strings are suitably short. We can iterate over ever possible pair (in the right order) and find the largest such number.\n",
    "\n",
    "In part 2, this will not suffice. The number strings in the input file have length 100, so to iterate over them in 12 nested loops would take an amount of time not incomporable to the age of the universe. We must be cleverer.\n",
    "\n",
    "An approach called **dynamic programming** will guide us home here! It's a concept a little like induction in mathematics: suppose we have an answer for a given 'state' - then from that, we can generate the answer for the next state. We need only begin with a base state (or sometimes base states).\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's focus on how we obtain $dp[1][1] = 9$ for a moment. It's kind of 'obvious', but what we actually did was took the largest 0 digit number using up to and including 0 characters of the input string, and added the 1st character '9' on the end.\n",

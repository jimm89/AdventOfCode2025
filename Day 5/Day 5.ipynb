    "In part 1, we could do something very simple here: for each ingredient, we could loop over all the fresh ranges and see if it sits in any of them. The inputs we are given will allow this, but once again it's not best practice. Let's think about why:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Suppose instead of approx. 200 ranges and approx. 1000 ingredients, we actually had 100,000 ranges and 100,000 ingredients. A naive solution would not scale well to those inputs, requiring in the region of 10 billion checks (each of which requires several operations). The complexity of this solution is $O(N * M)$ where $N$ is the number of ranges and $M$ is the number of ingredients.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make a significant improvement. Supposes we create an efficient set of ranges, by doing two things:\n",
    "- sorting our ranges in order\n",
    "- merging overlapping ranges into a single range\n",
    "\n",
    "How does this help? Well, we can use a technique called [binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search) (Python and most other languages have inbuilt functions to do this for us). This reduces our search time for a candidate interval down to $O(log(N))$. This technique will allow us to find the interval which will contain our ingredient **if there is any such interval**, and therefore will tell us whether the ingredient is fresh.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, instead of $(O(N * M))$, our solution is $O(N * log(N))$ for the initial sorting of our array, and $O(M * log(N))$ for processing the ingredients. This is much faster."

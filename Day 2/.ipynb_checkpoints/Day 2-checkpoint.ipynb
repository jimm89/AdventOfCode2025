    "This problem is asking us to identify numbers with repeating patterns within a certain range. In order to identify such numbers, we must first consider how such a number is constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In part 1, a number is 'invalid' if 'the first half' of the number matches 'the second half'. A very simple way to check for a given number is simply to write the number as a string of text, and see if the first half of the string matches the second half.\n",

Ordinary computers are good at doing approximately 1 billion mathematical operations per second, so this would immediately elevate our script runtime to a minimum of several hours.
